# SamplePortraitureMod
How to use this:

1. Edit the portraits in this folder to your heart's content.

2. Download portraiture and save it to your stardew mods folder https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/999?tab=description

3. To test, copy this folder into the portraiture/portraits folder. So it should be 
   something like Mods/Portraiture/Portraits/SamplePortraitureMod/<all these pngs>. 
   Start up your game. ***While talking to someone in-game, press P to cycle through their portraits.*** So far the only character I have updated for you is Robin. See the 
   Portraiture mod page on nexus for more details.

4. Once you are satisfied, rename this folder to be something other than SamplePortraitureMod, zip up this folder (using 7-zip or similar) and post on nexus (or don't if you want to keep this mod private). Delete/update this file with your own information before doing that.
